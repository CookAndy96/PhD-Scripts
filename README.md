This repository hosts all of my code for analysing simulations. As of writing this there is not a great deal, and it's a bit disgusting to look at but hopefully you may find some use out of it! I primarily work with \textsc{arepo} simulations
at the moment so the contents of these code includes the use of the analysis package "arepo-snap-utils".
