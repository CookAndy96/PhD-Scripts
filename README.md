# Analysis of cosmological simulations of the CGM

As I publish journal articles, I will update this repository with my analytical code in order for them to be publicly available should individuals want to replicate my results.

## cgm.py

My analysis of arepo simulations uses _arepo_snap_utils_ by Federico Marinacci and RÃ¼diger Pakmor to unpack the hdf5 files and easily read the data. Here, I created functions that would simplify the process further, including the algorithm for post-processing column density within these simulations. Comments will be added gradually to the script.
